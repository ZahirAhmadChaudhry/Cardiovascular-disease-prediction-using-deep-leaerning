 # Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Project

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) by utilizing artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze both structured and unstructured CVD-related data.

## üîç Research Questions

- Can we accurately predict the presence of cardiovascular disease based on given features?
- What are the most important features contributing towards CVD prediction?

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `data` : Contains the datasets utilized throughout the project.
	+ `UCI ML Repository`
	+ `Mendeley Data`
- `docs` : Documentation files (e.g. PDF reports).
- `notebooks` : Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
- `src` : Source code implementation (e.g. custom layers, optimizer classes, etc.).
- `presentation` : Slides summarizing key findings.
- `project_diagrams` : Architecture diagrams and flowcharts.

## üìä Usage

### Exploratory Data Analysis & Model Prototyping
Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and execute the provided Jupyter Notebooks according to the recommended order mentioned within each subdirectory.

#### Steps
1. Perform initial EDA on raw datasets.
2. Clean and preprocess data.
3. Feature engineering and selection.
4. Develop baseline machine learning models (e.g. logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, etc.) for comparison purposes.
5. Design and implement custom deep learning architectures (e.g. ANN, CNN, hybrid models).
6. Evaluate model performances through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

### Production-Ready Implementation
Access the `src` directory containing source codes implementing custom layers, optimizer functions, and other required components during the deployment stage. You can modify these scripts depending on your infrastructure setup.
