# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction System - Advancement Plan

## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based prediction system for cardiovascular disease using both tabular data and medical images. The current implementation includes basic models for both approaches with a Streamlit interface. Our advancement plan will focus on enhancing the base implementation, improving model robustness, and enhancing the user interface.

## Advancement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Code Enhancement (Weeks 1-2)
- Update base .py files to more robust and complete versions
- Enhance error handling and add detailed logging
- Optimize model implementations for better accuracy and efficiency
- Add comprehensive docstrings and comments
- Standardize code formatting across all files
- Improve data preprocessing for both tabular and image data

### Phase 2: User Interface Improvements (Weeks 3-4)
- Add option to test tabular data prediction with one-click dummy values
- Implement input validation with proper range checking for all fields
- Add descriptive tooltips with valid range values for each input field 
- Improve error handling to maintain form state when errors occur
- Create more detailed and informative prediction results
- Enhance the UI layout and visual design

### Phase 3: Testing and Documentation (Weeks 5-6)
- Create comprehensive test cases for all features
- Develop automated tests for critical functionality
- Document all UI features and user flows
- Create detailed developer documentation
- Improve README with detailed usage instructions
- Create visual guides for using the application

## Success Metrics
- Improved code robustness and readability
- Enhanced user experience with better error handling
- More informative UI with clear input requirements
- Increased prediction accuracy through optimized models
- Faster development iteration through better documentation
